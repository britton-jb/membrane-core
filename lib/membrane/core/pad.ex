  Pads are units defined by each element, allowing it to be linked with another
  elements. This module consists of pads typespecs and utils.

  Each pad is described by its name, direction, availability, mode and possible caps.
  For pads to be linkable, these properties have to be compatible. For more
  information on each of them, check appropriate type in this module.

  Each link can only consist of exactly two pads.

  @type direction_t :: :output | :input

  @typedoc """
  Describes how an element sends and receives data.
  Modes are strictly related to pad directions:

  - `:push` output pad - element can send data through such pad whenever it wants.
  - `:push` input pad - element has to deal with data whenever it comes through
  such pad, and do it fast enough not to let data accumulate on such pad, what
  may lead to overflow of element process erlang queue, which is highly unwanted.
  - `:pull` output pad - element can send data through such pad only if it have
  already received demand on the pad. Sending small, limited amount of
  undemanded data is supported and handled by `Membrane.Core.InputBuffer`.
  - `:pull` input pad - element receives through such pad only data that it has
  previously demanded, so that no undemanded data can arrive.

  Linking pads with different modes is possible, but only in case of output pad
  working in push mode, and input in pull mode. Moreover, toilet mode of
  `Membrane.Core.InputBuffer` has to be enabled then.

  For more information on transfering data and demands, see docs for element
  callbacks in `Membrane.Element.Base.*`.

  Values used when defining pad availability:

  - `:always` - a static pad, which can remain unlinked in `stopped` state only.
  - `:on_request` - a dynamic pad, instance of which is created every time it is
  linked to another pad. Thus linking the pad with _k_ other pads, creates _k_
  instances of the pad, and links each with another pad.

  Type describing availability mode of a created pad:

  - `:static` - there always exist exactly one instance of such pad.

  entails executing `handle_pad_added` and `handle_pad_removed` callbacks,
  respectively).
